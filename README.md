### Growth Mindset ðŸ§ 
'Growth Mindset' is the concept that intelligence is not static and can be developed. Examples of how I can practice 'Growth Mindset' include;
- Embracing challenges
- Learning from criticism
- Persisting when faced with obstacles

	~~I can't do it~~ **I'm still learning. I'll keep trying.**

	~~I'm not good at this~~ **This may take some time and effort.**

	~~I give up~~ **I can try a different strategy.**
