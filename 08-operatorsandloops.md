### Operators and Loops âž°
1. #What is an expression in JavaScript?# An expression is any valid set of literals, variables, operators, and expressions that evaluates to a single value. The value may be a number, a string, or a logical value.
2. #Why would we use a loop in our code?# Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false.
3. **When does a for loop stop executing?** A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false. 
4. #How many times will a while loop execute?# This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
