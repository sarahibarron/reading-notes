1. **What are variables in JavaScript?** 
Variables are containers for storing data (var, let)


2. **What does it mean to declare a variable?** 
A variable declaration is when you specify a type and an identifier, but have not yet assigned a value to the variable.  


3. **What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?** 
Assignment operators are used in Java to assign values to variables. For example,
    `int age;`
    `age = 5;`
    Here, **= is the assignment operator.** It assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left. That is, 5 is assigned to the variable age.


4. **What is information received from the user called?** 
Prompt.
